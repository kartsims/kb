The [OMG Network Knowledge Base](/) \(OMG KB\) was conceived as a joint effort between the OMG community and project team to support quality communication and discourse concerning the OMG Network. The OMG KB is maintained by [community contributors](https://github.com/buildOMG/kb/issues) and reflects an ongoing collection of curated information on the status and development of the [OMG Network](https://omisego.network/).
