# About the OMG network

The OMG Network is a scaling solution for finance on Ethereum, enabling transparent, peer-to-peer transactions in real-time. The decentralized network facilitates self-sovereign financial services across geographies, asset classes and applications.

The OMG Network is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed network of validators which enforce behavior of all participants. It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to create a proof-of-stake blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants.


## Vision

Access to mobile devices and Wi-Fi services have become ubiquitous. Simultaneously, global commerce and human mobility and migration continue to grow. As such, the ability to conduct payments anytime and anywhere is a necessity.

At OmiseGO, we believe an open platform that allows global buyers and sellers to meet directly and conduct global settlement will pave the way towards a future where payments can happen anywhere in the world in a way that is fast, fair and secure. We see a world with a borderless, open, financial system that is accessible to everyone.


## Mission

Our mission is to build an infrastructure for an open, financial system where payments are universal.
