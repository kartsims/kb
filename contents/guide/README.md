# What is OmiseGO ?

OmiseGO is a subsidiary of Omise, a leading online payment gateway service provider operating in Southeast Asia. The OmiseGO blockchain team has been involved in the Ethereum community from its very beginning—starting in 2015, Omise Blockchain Lab began research work focusing primarily on scalability. By the end of 2016, research had expanded into proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus design and in 2017, OmiseGO was created to achieve two goals:

1. Create the OMG Money Gateway as a scaling solution for Ethereum focused on enabling payments, trades, and other financial transactions in both crypto and at. OMG is a fully public, currency agnostic decentralized exchange (DEX) network which will be secured by Ethereum and built to scale infinitely using the Plasma architecture. The OMG Network will be able to interact with Bitcoin (or Bitcoin-like blockchains) and other blockchain platforms through clearinghouses in state channels or smart contracts, as well as with digital at platforms and economies through collateralized at tokens. This, in combination with virtually unlimited scalability, will enable the OMG Network to serve essentially all global transactions simultaneously. 
2. Develop the OMG open-source, white label digital wallet Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK will be free for anyone to use and will make it easy for those who need online asset exchange as part of their business to connect seamlessly to the OMG Network. The SDK allows wallet providers the flexibility to enhance, add, and customize payment solutions for many use cases. More detail...

OMG is the answer to a fundamental coordination problem amongst payment processors, gateways and financial institutions. By enabling decentralized exchange at high volume and low cost, OMG provides a next-generation value transfer service operating across currencies and asset types, and across national borders and corporate ledgers.

Through the OMG network, anyone will be able to conduct real-time, peer-to-peer financial transactions, including but not limited to payments, remittances, payroll deposit, B2B commerce, supply-chain nance, loyalty program activity, asset management, and other on-demand services in a completely decentralized and inexpensive way, and including highly performant and fully decentralized trading.

OMG offers mainstream end-customers an introduction to the many benefits of blockchain technology—the wallet SDK will make it easy to create dapps that let the end user take advantage of Ethereum’s immense potential without having to leave their comfort zone.

Omise will use the OMG network as the platform for their own payments processing needs, but _**neither Omise nor OmiseGO will own or control the network.**_


## Points of view

### Investor

* OMG is an ERC20 token whose main function is to be staked. Staking the token means purchasing an arbitrary amount of tokens, and put it at stake to validate the transactions going on the network, generating passive revenues for its owner.
* It is backed by Omise, an established South-East Asia company, already running transactions for over XX merchants. While they are currently running theirs txs on their own network, they'll eventually migrate them to the OMG network to lower their costs.
* While a lot of blockchain projects start without actual usage, OMG is practically assured to have some tx from the get go. Read the roadmap for more information about the different stages of the launch.
* OMG is also partnering with other projects/companies to provide an easy access to their network, enabling 3rd parties to access their DEX (decentralized exchange, enabling currency exchanges instantly and seamlessly for the end user, include link to the KB) and the eWallet SDK (toolkit provided to other companies to interact with the blockchain, enabling among other things to create a reward program or top up a shop-specific account, include link to KB). More to be announced about the partnerships ~soon~. All these partner's txs would be run on the OMG network, tx fees being redistributed amongst stakers (OMG will be staking 20% of the tokens themselves).

### Technologist

* OMG is leading the Ethereum research on [Plasma](concepts.html#plasma-the-basics), a layer-2 scaling solution that would enable a much higher throughput of transactions, ultimately secured on the Ethereum chain (root chain).
* Thanks to Plasma, an efficient DEX backend will be built, on top of which any front end could plug in.
* The eWallet SDK is a toolkit provided by 3rd parties to build applications that interact with the OMG network, allowing access to the DEX and enabling anyone to create its own "currency" or rewards program on the network.
* Fully open source, check the repos here and there.

### Blockchain enthusiast

* OMG's core values are aligned with its baseline "Unbank the banked" which is to provide a way to exchange values anywhere in the world, even to people who can't afford to be included in the banking system. While it is _not_ an "anti-bank" movement, it intends to democratize access to basic financial services, targeting first SEA as it is an ever growing market with a real need for such service.
* OMG has proven a deep implication in the Ethereum ecosystem by giving a grant to the ECF and being involved with Ethereum founders and core team since 2015. It also shares its mission by building a fully decentralized network, completely open source.

## Why do we need OMG?

Ultimately, blockchain solves one problem : **coordination**.

The central paradox of human society is that we need to conduct transactions on a mass scale to accomplish our ends, but are simultaneously unwilling to trust anyone outside our immediate circle.

Throughout history, societies have tried to circumvent this problem by constructing various ever-more-elaborate mechanisms, all of which still rely on trust at some level: governments, banks, clearinghouses, arbitrators and the legal system are all institutions that we have little choice but to trust with our money, our identities, our histories and our futures. There is no guarantee that they will be competent enough to secure those things adequately; no guarantee that they will act honestly or responsibly; no guarantee that the rules of the game will not change without warning; and taken to the extreme, no guarantee that these institutions will continue to exist at all.

Applying this to the current financial system, assets such as currencies are locked up in a messy web of indirect ownership and delayed settlement. Transferring assets from one party to another often requires point-to-point interaction between multiple intermediaries, and reconciliation of duplicated ledgers held by multiple parties. Even between these parties there is a lack of trust, leading to a proliferation of convoluted systems designed to protect financial institutions from each other and themselves—and paid for by the consumer.

Blockchains allow us to create a single shared ledger, or an interoperable network of provably coordinated ledgers, on which ownership and status of an asset can be immutably recorded. We aim to create such a ledger on a global scale, by constructing a lightweight and highly scalable and secure blockchain which directly integrates with the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts.
