# Community & Communication ~

From the very beginning the community response to OMG has been incredible. We are grateful for your support, and optimistic that the enthusiasm around the project bodes well for the future of decentralized networks. Big thanks to token holders and stakers, who are the key to the network's function, security and growth; individuals and teams who have contributed to OMG; to the businesses who are eager to become early adopters; and to members of our various online communities who continuously challenge and encourage us.
