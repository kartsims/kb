In its initial phases, the OMG DEX will serve as the base layer for a collection of venues (platforms where orders to trade digital assets are arranged and executed) that perform order matching outside of the OMG Network consensus, with provable on-chain settlement on the OMG network. In other words, order matching is performed off-chain and any order that is either settled or canceled will be processed as a transaction on the OMG Network, and have to pay fees accordingly.</p> <p>The first iteration of the DEX will use a construction we're calling Restricted Custody, which we settled on as the best compromise between giving users total control of their funds for the majority of the time and keeping as many transactions as possible on chain, without sacrificing liquidity. Users have full custody until they place an order, at which time custody is transferred to the venue until the order is either filled or cancelled. During the time that venues have custody of user funds on the OMG DEX, user funds still have an extra layer of protection in that an attempted malicious act by the venue (or a hacker) can be blocked by the operator or by the child chain consensus.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*IPdKM2bkk-Uzio55" alt=""></p> <h2 id="omg-dex-design"><a href="#omg-dex-design" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> OMG DEX Design</h2> <h3 id="the-omg-decentralized-exchange-odex"><a href="#the-omg-decentralized-exchange-odex" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The OMG decentralized Exchange (ODEX)</h3> <p>The term decentralized is a very broad term and typically is a catch-all for a number of characteristics or dimensions.

In order to provide clarity and consistency of understanding when talking about decentralization, or more specifically a DEX, we've decided to decompose our use of the term into a non exhaustive list of dimensions. We can then use these dimensions to describe the OMG DEX itself, its benefits and detail how we will prioritize its development.

The following diagram is a high level view of what we think the future state of the ODEX may look like. This diagram will be described in detail throughout the remaining sections. A key observation should be that the ODEX is more than just a single market. It is an infrastructure upon which any participant can engage in using, making or delivering a market. This means many market models can be supported, all with the same underlying benefits and guarantees of the ODEX, while simultaneously offering tailored trading experiences as appropriate to the target users. This means that ODEX is more than just a single market, it is a network supporting many markets with both direct users of the ODEX co-existing beside indirect users of the ODEX such as venues themselves.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/blob/develop/docs/assets/dex_design/01_ODEX%20Features.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/raw/develop/docs/assets/dex_design/01_ODEX%20Features.png" alt="ODEX Overview"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h4 id="restricted-custody"><a href="#restricted-custody" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Restricted Custody</h4> <p>OmiseGO proposes a solution whereby user funds are secured by the child chain consensus mechanism. The exchange of value occurs in a secure manner, which vastly reduces the risk exposure for both a venue <em>and</em> for the user.</p> <p>We can provide this custodial safety using a model which utilizes the safety of the child chain consensus mechanism.</p> <p>Restricted Custody allows custody transfer to an off-chain venue to facilitate matching but only allows the venue to perform the required, fundamental actions, such as partial matching, canceling and initiation of settlement.</p> <p>The constraints that are placed upon funds in custody of a venue are:</p> <ul><li>The venue can neither deposit nor exit from the child chain</li> <li>Transactions to move funds must be represented as trade settlements. The venue must prove that the beneficiaries of the settlements wanted to trade (by their signed orders).</li></ul> <p>In other words, a venue cannot spend or exit user funds.</p> <p>Therefore, whilst users may transfer custody of their funds to a venue, the users will rely on the safety of the child chain consensus to enforce how a users' funds may be used. Also, importantly, this facilitates, in an efficient and fundamental way, firm orders. Firm orders are an essential component of any fair market.</p> <p>Note that work on Restricted Custody is continuing and changes can be expected to this design.</p> <h4 id="multiple-venues"><a href="#multiple-venues" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Multiple Venues</h4> <p>As stated in the introduction the ODEX will support multiple venues, removing single points of failure and reducing the possibility that a user will be refused exchange services. Multiple venues increases censorship resistance.</p> <p>The possible addition of an on-chain exchange in the future would add much greater censorship resistance.</p> <h4 id="off-chain-markets"><a href="#off-chain-markets" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Off-Chain Markets</h4> <p>Off-chain markets (typically orderbook driven) are important, not only to move computationally intensive tasks away from the operator/validators, but also to give venues the flexibility to change their market microstructure (such as minimum tick size, fee structure and so on) to ensure a competitive and differentiated market for an exchange's services, and markets themselves. It also has material implications on the speed and efficiency of the matching and trading process as we will see later.</p> <h4 id="on-chain-markets-parallel-phase"><a href="#on-chain-markets-parallel-phase" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> On-Chain Markets (Parallel Phase)</h4> <p>In conjunction with off-chain markets, an on-chain market that is maintained by the child chain consensus system may be added. Further research is underway in this area to identify how an on-chain market, which could be offered using an orderbook structure, fits into the ODEX market model. It is also possible that multiple on-chain markets may be supported to differentiate between the specific needs of particular markets.</p> <p>The research and the introduction of an on-chain market may occur in parallel to the development of off-chain market support.</p> <p>Initially, it is thought that an on-chain market would have the following characteristics:</p> <ul><li>Call market, rather than continuous market</li> <li>Auction based mechanism built on an orderbook</li></ul> <p>Whilst an on-chain market may not offer the best price to participants (for example, because of lower liquidity concentration or slowness in reacting to fundamental changes in value), the on-chain market can offer guaranteed access to an exchange mechanism for participants that cannot, or choose not to, gain access to other venues on the ODEX.</p> <h4 id="batch-settlement"><a href="#batch-settlement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Batch Settlement</h4> <p>Without batch settlement, it would be expected for venues to immediately settle any order execution. In a low transaction environment that can work effectively however it doesn't scale particularly well. By supporting batch settlement we can reduce the number of transactions required for settlement, and it is therefore useful for:</p> <ul><li>Auctions</li> <li>Efficiently settling in highly liquid markets</li> <li>Atomic settlement where multiple orders are resolved simultaneously, such as options markets</li> <li>Settlement of implied orders. Implied orders are necessary for the OmiseGO core user story. Implied orders enable the exchange of two assets that do not directly trade against one another. For example,
<ul><li>A user has Burger tokens and a cafe accepts Coffee tokens</li> <li>There is no market for BURGER/COFFEE tokens</li> <li>However, there is a market for BURGER/ETH and ETH/COFFEE</li> <li>Therefore an implied price and an implied order can be derived</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="proveable-trade-settlement"><a href="#proveable-trade-settlement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proveable Trade Settlement</h4> <p>A venue will not be allowed to 'spend' or move funds in an unconstrained manner. Instead funds may only be 'settled' and a proof must be produced by the venue with the orders that constitute the resultant settlement.</p> <p>Proveable trade settlement increases the safety of the exchange for users and provides valuable post-trade transparency (see next section).</p> <h4 id="pre-trade-and-post-trade-transparency"><a href="#pre-trade-and-post-trade-transparency" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pre-trade and Post-trade Transparency</h4> <p>Post-trade transparency provides trade information after a trade has been executed. Whereas pre-trade transparency indicates prices at which participants are willing to pay. High quality, and trusted transparency is an essential requirement for fair markets and good price discovery.</p> <p>Transparency is also important because the data can be used to predict price changes and to validate the proofs generated by venues on the ODEX.</p> <p>Whilst there may be multiple venues operating independently on the ODEX, information about how the market is operating may be consolidated.</p> <p>A 'global' ticker tape could be derived for:</p> <ul><li>Prices for all trade executions for a particular venue, or the network as a whole</li> <li>Last price for any instrument (currency pair such as ETH/OMG)</li> <li>Trusted pricing metrics and price movements for any instrument could be offered as an extension to basic ticker information</li></ul> <h4 id="order-privacy"><a href="#order-privacy" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Order Privacy</h4> <p>In traditional markets, order details are private to a trader. This is a very important as it allows traders to take positions which reflect what they see as the fundamental value of the instrument being traded, without the knowledge that <em>they</em> are taking a position or <em>how</em> they are taking the position. If the order details were public other traders could use it to infer information about the instrument's value or other traders intent and strategies. For example that a specific trader was hedging one instrument against another. It is also a key aspect of fair markets in general, and so it is highly undesirable for this information to be made public.</p> <h3 id="odex-phases"><a href="#odex-phases" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> ODEX Phases</h3> <h4 id="introduction-2"><a href="#introduction-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Introduction</h4> <p>In this section we present our current phasing of development for ODEX to illustrate how we can incrementally prove out the features of ODEX that underpin the value proposition captured by the previous dimensions of decentralization.

Batch settlements most importantly will enable implied orders, which are required to fulfill one of the primary OmiseGO use cases (see Appendix).</p> <p>Batch settlement optimizes the settlement process because settlement is the net outcome of all of the trades in a batch. Matching must be performed in a deterministic way such that proofs may be independently verified.</p> <p>Phase 1 and phase 2 have an interesting safety property. Since the private key for a venue is only used to sign proofs for settlements, loss of the private key will not result in user funds being lost. However, if an attacker was able to gain access to a venue's private key, the attacker may be able to spam the network.</p> <p>Caution: Care must be taken to ensure that computation complexity of validating all of the settlement proofs can be accommodated by both a single operator (in PoA) and by the target validator sizing (in PoS).</p> <h4 id="phase-3-bonded-exchanges"><a href="#phase-3-bonded-exchanges" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Phase 3 - Bonded Exchanges</h4> <p><a href="https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/blob/develop/docs/assets/dex_design/04_Phase%203%20-%20Bonded%20Exchages.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/raw/develop/docs/assets/dex_design/04_Phase%203%20-%20Bonded%20Exchages.png" alt="phase 3 diagram"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>Phase 3 introduces an explicit economic disincentive for a venue to perform bad behavior.

However, it may be possible for the bond to be sized proportionally to the amount of risk on the order books of an exchange.

In other words the basic economic details of a trade is known (the price and quantity), but not the specific details of the orders that were executed to complete that trade. This details could include information such as who traded, any limit price, original quantity and so on. Were this information available it would be very difficult for any trader to achieve a fair price with risk of adverse selection and therefore transitory volatility would increase in the market, damaging price discovery and increasing the cost of trading overall.</p> <p>Some flexibility may be possible with order privacy, whereby some order details are public and some order details are not public. This may be on a per venue or a per order basis.

A well functioning market has many characteristics and the features of ODEX previously discussed has already called out many of these. The purpose of this section is to call out, in a practical sense, the requirements that need to be met to support the OmiseGO vision.</p> <h4 id="market-microstructure"><a href="#market-microstructure" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Market Microstructure</h4> <p>In order to appreciate the detail in this section we need to introduce how we define the concept of market duration.</p> <p>Any market can exist for an arbitrary period of time, and in fact while someone, somewhere is making a market in a particular instrument we can say there exists a market for that instrument. In practical terms however we must assume that for any venue there will be a period over which they explicitly make a market for an instrument. In a traditional venue these market durations are usually determined by wider practical limitations.</p> <p>For example most market durations are a single day, with the market being reset each day, or perhaps over a week with the market being reset, or paused weekly. These limitations can be things like people sleep at night and therefore in a localized market there will only be thin trading overnight so the markets simply close. It could be aligned to a feature of the instrument and so on.</p> <p>In the crypto markets we tend to have global 24/7 markets and so concepts like a trading &quot;day&quot; are less valuable. However these concepts are still critical in operating an effective and orderly market as they facilitate things like the ability to determine orders are stale, or provide an opportunity to perform market resets, or venue maintenance.</p> <h5 id="market-duration"><a href="#market-duration" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Market Duration</h5> <p>To help us identify and understand the market structures that the ODEX must support we have adopted a taxonomy, really a vocabulary, for describing market duration so as to allow us to anchor the requirements we will place on ODEX to support any overlaid market model. This vocabulary is as follows:</p> <ul><li>Any market can be divided into Trading Cycles (a cycle could for example last a day)</li> <li>A Trading Cycle may have one or more Trading Phases (within a cycle you might have a pre-open, open, after-hours and close phase)</li> <li>Each Trading Phases may be decomposed into Trading Sessions (a session might be an auction session, or a continuous trading session)</li></ul> <p>With this macro view of market duration, as delivered by any one specific venue on the ODEX, we can now be more specific about duration requirements as they relate to the ODEX itself. Any venue connected to the ODEX can of course adopt any duration model they like but the vocabulary identified will allow those models to be mapped as needed to the features that ODEX offers.</p> <h5 id="required-order-types"><a href="#required-order-types" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Required Order Types</h5> <p>This section details the minimal characteristics of orders that must be supported.

The design document expands on these required phases, the design, and the reasoning behind the priorities set for each phase of development.</p> <p>We also want to be transparent about the limitations of the current design. We spent a good deal of time carefully considering the implications of different proposed implementations in the design of the OMG DEX for important factors such as transparency, scalability, privacy, fairness, liquidity and responsiveness. We have laid out what we believe is the best path to achieve the long-term goal of decentralization while also supporting development of a liquid, well operating market in the short term.</p> <p><strong>Overview</strong></p> <p>In the OMG DEX design and in this post, the term &quot;venue&quot; has a similar meaning to &quot;exchange&quot;. A venue is a place where orders (to trade digital assets) are arranged and executed — in other words, a place where a market is provided. Examples of venues include existing centralized crypto exchanges, decentralized exchanges, and traditional stock exchanges.</p> <p>In its initial phases, the OMG DEX will serve as the base layer for a collection of venues that perform order execution outside of the OMG Network consensus, with provable on-chain settlement on the OMG network (i.e., order matching is performed off-chain and any order that is either settled or canceled will be processed as a transaction — and incur transaction fees — on the OMG Network).</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WMPIIrJxlH0WJO10KSYSTQ.png" alt=""></p> <p><strong>Design Goals</strong></p> <p>There are many different types of decentralized exchanges being built or launched on numerous platforms. This is a healthy discourse for the ecosystem, but it can be confusing; so we feel it's important to help our users understand what <em>we</em> mean when we talk about a decentralized exchange. In order to do that, we first need to identify and define what characteristics or <em>dimensions</em> we consider important for an exchange mechanism that is fast, fair and safe.</p> <p><strong>Trustless</strong></p> <p>Users should be in control of their own assets: they should not need to trust a third party, nor should they need permission from a third party in order to access or use their funds.</p> <p>While the OMG Network will initially have an operator (OmiseGO) rather than a distributed validator set, and venues will initially be operated by central parties, there are layers of security such that users are not trusting any single party to remain honest. If a venue tries to steal user funds, an honest operator will block the misbehavior. Conversely, if the operator misbehaves, an honest venue will bypass the operator and exit user funds to Ethereum. In short, user funds are safe as long as the venue and the operator do not collude. Once the responsibility of consensus becomes distributed across a network of stakers/validators rather than OmiseGO operating as the sole operator, the potential for collusion is diluted proportionally to the size of the validator set.</p> <p><strong>Secure</strong></p> <p>We consider protection of user funds to be the most critical concern in the design of a decentralized exchange. During the time that venues have custody of user funds on the OMG DEX, user funds are still secured either by the operator or by the child chain consensus. This actually reduces risk for venues as well as its customers. Centralized exchanges expose themselves to operational risk, and potentially legal risk as well, when they take responsibility for the safety of user funds.</p> <p>By restricting the conditions under which the venue takes control of funds, the total value for which the venue is responsible at any given time is drastically reduced; while the additional layer of security provided by the operator or child chain consensus means that a hack or other attack on the exchange is much less likely to result in loss of funds since there is no single point of failure. We anticipate existing centralized venues will be interested in connecting to the OMG DEX in order to both tap into a wider liquidity pool than is available within a siloed channel, and significantly reduce their own operational risk.</p> <p>The safety mechanisms described above are detailed in the OMG DEX <a href="https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/blob/develop/docs/dex_design.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design document<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> and Tesuji Plasma design documents.</p> <p><strong>Transparent</strong></p> <p>Exchanges should also be fair and transparent. Here transparency refers both to transparency of venue and user behaviour, as well as transparency of market information such as pricing. Where transparency isn't possible or desired due to the business needs of a venue, correct behaviour should nonetheless be both provable and enforceable.</p> <p><strong>Liquid</strong></p> <p>In order to build a DEX that supports a liquid market for the OMG Network and to reduce potential latency due to limitations on operator/validator capacity, we've chosen to start with support for off-chain continuous markets. Support for continuous markets allows venues to provide a much more flexible and seamless experience for their users: in a continuous market, trades may be executed at any time during a trading session (24/7 for crypto markets), as opposed to a call market where buyers and sellers must wait for specific times when a market is 'called' to trade. Stock markets and most crypto exchanges are continuous markets; the best known example of a call market would probably be US Treasury Bond <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/quarterly-refunding/Documents/auctions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">auctions<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <p><strong>Uncensorable</strong></p> <p>Everyone should be able to access services that allow them to exchange any digital assets, whether tokenized property, cryptocurrencies, or other tradable tokens. There should be no individual that has the ability to block access to exchange services. Put simply, access to a decentralized exchange should be permissionless.</p> <p>Censorship resistance is a function of the number and variety of available venues; since there can only be a limited number of venues in the initial design, there are corresponding limitations on censorship resistance in this first iteration.</p> <p><strong>Additional Design Considerations</strong></p> <p>A constraining factor affecting the design of the OMG DEX is the future computational capacity of stakers. A high speed, central limit order book requires a large amount of memory and CPU processing power. We need to balance the speed and latency of order matching with the target computational load for stakers such that hardware requirements are not burdensome.</p> <p>By moving order matching off-chain, we move the computational requirements for the processing of the order book away from the operator and validators. However, the operator — and later stakers — will be responsible for validating settlement proofs for every trade, whether completed or canceled. Since processing power is finite, there will be a natural limit to the number of off-chain venues the network can support. These limitations will become more clear as specifics of the Proof of Stake mechanism are resolved and the target specifications (such as CPU and memory) for each validator are defined.</p> <p>We are actively researching an on-chain order book, and particularly how an on-chain, batch-based order book should be implemented to contribute additional liquidity, volume and further censorship resistance, without exceeding the load capacity of the validator set. Simply put, complex state transitions are hard to carry out in Plasma. We plan to implement batch auctions in the latter phase and are researching the details of how it can be done safely and efficiently within the specific context of OMG Plasma.</p> <hr> <p>It is important to note that the design of the OMG DEX will continue to evolve as we continue to research the technology required to build our vision. The limit on the number of venues in particular is viewed as a short-term tradeoff in favor of a more efficient and liquid market — not a built-in constraint of the OMG DEX design itself, but a puzzle to be solved in the course of our continued effort to reduce per-transaction computational load.</p> <p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that mainnet release of Tesuji Plasma is not dependent on DEX implementation.
